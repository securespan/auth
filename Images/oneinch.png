During one of the live streams, Anton Bukov, who would later become the co-founder of 1inch, joined in. The two developers hit it off and, for the next six months, Anton became the co-host of the channel, now renamed to CryptoManiacs. Together, they participated in 17 hackathons around the globe. Later, at a hackathon in New York in May 2019, they developed an aggregator MVP for decentralized exchanges.","pressRoom.biography.texts.2.text":"Anton Bukov started programming at the age of 12 by attending evening university classes for secondary school students.
